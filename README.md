# Portfolio-Website
An updated and more complete portfolio website

This site is now published at http://afwatkins.com through google domains!

This site is still under construction!!!

In this updated portfolio site I implemented a parallax scrolling effect. I set a class for each of the parallax divs to style each accordingly. Some of the parallax images have elements on top of them. These elements were included inside of the parallax div, otherwise the other elements were included in a container div outside of the parallax div. The container divs include the about me, projects and contact section.

The navbar had a scroll and fade in and out method set to fade the navbar when the window object is scrolled. I want to eventually improve the navbar.

The about me section has an expandable section with a click event listener made possible by jQuery. I eventually want to add a slideshow of images using jQuery in this section when I have more time. When the contact me button is clicked it hide a majority of the page and appends a contact form to a parallax div (when the button is clicked the hide class is removed from this parallax div).

The footer of the page needs a lot of improvement.

The site is Mobily responsive.
